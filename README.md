### Objective

The main objective of the this project is to work on a larger design that also includes the hardware implementation of several types of digital signal processing algorithms. In addition, the hardware design and implementation must meet the 50 MHz clock constraint, some latency constraints (defined by specific multiplier usage), while ensuring that hardware resources are not wasted.
